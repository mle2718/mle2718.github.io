# .Rprofile -- Execute some R commands at the beginning of each R session
# You can use this file to load packages, set options, etc.
# It's a particularly good place to store usernames, passwords, or the location of an oracle server. 
# Just make sure you never commit the file to a git repository.


# To use this, delete _sample and put this in a place that R searches for a .Rprofile file.
# One good place to put this file is the result of Sys.getenv("HOME")
# Don't delete the leading period   

# NOTE: changes in this file won't be reflected until after you quit
# and start a new session

# Load the NEFSC network into a variable
network_location_desktop = "<the_ipaddress_to_the_network>"
# This might work better 
network_location_desktop = "blah.blah..noaa.gov"
network_location_remote = "//net"

# You might even want to store your database usernames and passwords here, so they are always loaded into the R environment when you start up R.
